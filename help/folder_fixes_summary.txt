FOLDERS TAB FIXES - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

HIGH PRIORITY FIXES:

1. ADD FOLDER - Make it immediate and intuitive
   - Show input dialog to enter folder name
   - Create folder with that name
   - Select it in the tree automatically
   - User can then add profiles to it

2. UPDATE ITEM - Make it work and be obvious
   - Already works, but needs better UX
   - Consider auto-update on text change OR
   - Make button more prominent with tooltip

3. ADD PROFILE - Fix the workflow
   - Should show dialog to select profile from ALL profiles
   - Add to current folder if folder selected
   - Add to root if nothing selected
   - Don't require profile dropdown to be enabled

4. PROFILE DROPDOWN - Remove confusion
   - This dropdown is only for CHANGING which profile an entry points to
   - Most users won't need this
   - Redesign UI to make this clearer

5. DISPLAY ALL PROFILES
   - Expand remainingProfiles to show actual profiles
   - Show profiles NOT in newTabMenu at all
   - Make it visual which profiles are assigned where

6. MOVE UP/DOWN - Fix for profiles in folders
   - Currently only works on top-level items
   - Need to get parent and reorder within parent's entries

KEY USER CONFUSION:
- Users think "Profile dropdown" is for selecting which profile to ADD
- Actually it's for CHANGING which profile an existing entry points to
- Need to separate "Add Profile" (select from list) from "Change Profile" (change existing entry)

BETTER WORKFLOW:
1. Add Folder: Dialog → Enter name → Created and selected
2. Add Profile: Dialog → Pick from ALL profiles → Added to current location
3. Update Item: Either auto-update OR obvious button
4. Move/Reorder: Drag-drop OR Move Up/Down works everywhere
