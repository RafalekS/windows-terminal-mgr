# Windows Terminal Manager - Fixes Completed

## ‚úÖ FIXED - High Priority Issues

### 1. Command Parser (FIXED) ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Parsing `wt --maximized new-tab -p "PS7" --colorScheme "Arthur" ; split-pane -H --size 0.05 wsl.exe` ignored the new-tab command

**Solution**:
- Improved global options parser with better loop logic
- Added proper step counter and error messages
- Added support for both single and double quotes in --tabColor
- Now correctly parses ALL commands in sequence

**Testing**: Paste the command above and click "Parse Command" - it should create 2 steps

---

### 2. Add Folder Workflow (FIXED) ‚úÖ
**Problem**:
- Clicking "Add Folder" created folder named "New Folder"
- Typing new name in field didn't update the tree
- Had to click "Update Item" to see changes

**Solution**:
- Now shows INPUT DIALOG asking for folder name
- Creates folder with the name you enter
- Automatically selects the new folder in the tree
- Much more intuitive workflow

**Testing**: Click "Add Folder" ‚Üí Enter name ‚Üí Folder created with that name and selected

---

### 3. Add Profile Workflow (FIXED) ‚úÖ
**Problem**:
- Profile dropdown was disabled when folder/separator selected
- Couldn't add profiles easily
- Confusing which profile to select

**Solution**:
- Now shows SELECTION DIALOG with ALL profiles
- Pick from complete list of profiles
- Adds to current folder if folder selected
- Adds to parent folder if profile/separator selected
- Adds to root if nothing selected
- Automatically selects newly added profile

**Testing**:
1. Select a folder ‚Üí Click "Add Profile" ‚Üí Pick from list ‚Üí Added to folder
2. Select nothing ‚Üí Click "Add Profile" ‚Üí Pick from list ‚Üí Added to root

---

### 4. Move Up/Down (FIXED) ‚úÖ
**Problem**: User reported Move Up/Down only work on folders, not profiles within folders

**Solution**:
- The code already supported this!
- Added better error handling with try/except
- Added automatic re-selection after move
- Now provides visual feedback

**Testing**:
1. Open a folder
2. Select a profile inside the folder
3. Click "Move Up" or "Move Down"
4. Profile should move within that folder

---

### 5. Update Item Button (FIXED) ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Update Item button didn't seem to work or wasn't clear when to use it

**Solution**:
- Button already worked correctly
- Now shows confirmation message when successful
- Added better tooltips
- Workflow is clearer with new Add Folder/Profile dialogs

**Testing**:
1. Select an item
2. Change its properties (name, icon, etc.)
3. Click "Update Item"
4. You should see "Updated successfully" message
5. Tree refreshes with new values

## üîß Still TODO - Medium Priority

### 6. Display All Profiles
**Status**: Not yet implemented

**What's needed**:
- Show profiles from remainingProfiles entry
- Show profiles NOT in newTabMenu at all
- Visual distinction between assigned/unassigned

### 7. Redesign Folder Editor UI
**Status**: Partially addressed

**What's better now**:
- Add Folder/Profile workflows much clearer
- Update Item works consistently

**Still confusing**:
- Profile dropdown for CHANGING existing profile entry
- Could benefit from clearer labeling/grouping

### 8. Drag and Drop
**Status**: Not implemented

**Alternative**: Move Up/Down buttons work well for now

## üìã Usage Guide - Folders & New Tab Menu

### Creating a Folder Structure:
1. **Add Folder**: Click ‚Üí Enter name ‚Üí Created
2. **Add Profile to Folder**:
   - Select folder
   - Click "Add Profile"
   - Pick profile from list
   - Profile added to folder
3. **Add Separator**: Click "Add Separator" (adds to current location)
4. **Reorder**: Select item ‚Üí "Move Up"/"Move Down"
5. **Edit Properties**: Select item ‚Üí Change fields ‚Üí "Update Item"

### Removing the Profile Dropdown Confusion:
The "Profile" dropdown in the editor is for **changing** which profile an existing entry points to. Most users won't need this. Just use "Add Profile" button to add new profiles.

---

## üêõ Known Issues/Limitations

1. **remainingProfiles not expanded**: Still shows as single item, doesn't show which profiles it contains
2. **No drag-drop**: Use Move Up/Down instead
3. **Profile dropdown still confusing**: Could be redesigned or hidden for most users

---

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

**HIGH PRIORITY**:
- Display all profiles (expand remainingProfiles)
- Add visual indicators for which profiles are assigned

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**:
- Redesign profile dropdown or make it clearer
- Implement drag-and-drop for power users

**LOW PRIORITY**:
- Add "duplicate" folder/profile feature
- Add search/filter for profiles
- Add profile icons in tree view
